This project is a simple script to check if a given year is a leap year or not.
The script uses conditional statements to determine if the input year meets the criteria for a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar.

Takes user input for the year.
Checks if the year is a leap year based on the following rules:
  - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
  - However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
